Meeting Log 4/30
Questions: 
1. Form of input (Full screen of the scenario vs Smaller vision of the scenario) to agent
2. Can we use POMDP in our research? 
3. Relative vision for the agent
4. Reward function (how we design it?)
5. Is there any research about the scenario where 'agent will not affect by the physics, but the other objects in the environment will be affected by the physics'. 
6. How can we include physics puzzle in the scenario? 
7. Good pratices to create a new benchmark?
